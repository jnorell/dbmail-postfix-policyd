Currently only a Quota Check is performed, allowing some mail to be
rejected in SMTP that would otherwise push a user over their quota limits
(rather than accepting the mail in SMTP and generating a bounce message).
That keeps undeliverable bounce messages out of your local mail queue,
and is better net etiquitte.
